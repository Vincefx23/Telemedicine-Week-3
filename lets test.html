                    <h4>Telemedicine</h4>
                    <p>“Telemedicine refers to the provision of remote clinical services, 
                      via real-time two-way communication between the patient and the healthcare provider, 
                      using electronic audio and visual means.”</p>
                </aside>

                  <p class="para">Telemedicine, a term coined in the 1970s by Thomas Bird,
                     literally translates as “healing at a distance” — from Latin “medicus” and Greek “tele.”
                    The inventions of communication tools like the telegraph and the telephone jumpstarted the practice of telemedicine.
                     Healthcare professionals used various ways of communicating medical information beforehand, 
                     such as signal flags on ships to warn about a potentially contagious disease. However,
                      these communication tools were extensions of human messengers rather than transmitting medical data over large distances.
                    The introduction of telegraphs and telephones brought forth telemedicine or telehealth. </p>
                    
                    <p class="para">These two inventions technically allowed anyone to send messages or communicate over large distances, although the telegraph required some specialized knowledge to operate.
                    The military immediately recognized and took advantage of the sheer communication speed of telegraphs and telephones for healthcare purposes, and the expansion eventually included everyday communication.</p>

                        <h2>Origin</h2>
                        <p class="para">Telemedicine has come a long way since the early 20th century, 
                          when doctors would listen to stethoscope sounds over the phone. With the current state of technology,
                           a licensed medical professional can perform medical examinations through telemedicine video visits and diagnose and treat patients remotely.</p>

                        <p>The distance between doctors and patients is no longer a barrier. 
                          Patients schedule online appointments with a single click of a mouse or a tap on their phone screen with a telemedicine software solution.
                           They don’t have to drive to the nearest healthcare provider’s office — telemedicine makes it possible to receive medical care from home or any other private location.</p>
